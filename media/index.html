         <h2><u> Shannon's Journey </u></h2>
         <p>During the summer of 2016, my life changed right before my eyes. I gave birth to my first child - a little girl. Shortly after her birth, I decided to leave my job as a social worker to become a full-time stay-at-home-mom. Though it required lots of sacrafice, it was the best decision for our family.</p>
         <p>While being a SAHM, I started writing for a local mom's blog and continued to develop my own website, Girls Inspiring Girls - a website focused on young women's mental health. While developing my website, I had lots of questions and ideas to implement on my website. My husband, who is a computer science engineer, encouraged me to learn how to code.</p>
         <p>Since January 2018, I have been on a journey to learn code with a focus on Front End Web Development. In January 2018, I was awared the "Grow with Google" scholarship for Front End Web Development in order to complete a three month program through Udacity. In April 2018, I completed the program and received a scholarship to complete a "nanodegree" through Udacity. I have taken courses through Udacity, Codecademy, and currently TWP 3.0. In May, I will go on to complete a "nanodgree" in Front End Web Development through Udacity.</p>
         <p>When I'm not coding or chasing my toddler, you can find me writing out my thoughts on my website,<a href = "http://girlsinspiring.com/your-mistakes-do-not-define-you">Girls Inspiring Girls</a>. My work has also appeared on Chattanooga Mom's Blog, where I am a regular contributer. Check out my latest <a href = "https://chattanooga.citymomsblog.com/personal-growth/code-like-mother/">post</a>.</p>
