  <p>Hi there, I'm Shannon Hartin. I'm a twenty-something social worker turned stay-at-home-mom <s>turned</s> (<em>or turning</em>) into a coder!</p>
  <br>
  <h2> Shannon's Journey </h2>
  <p> On August 17, 2016, my life changed right before my eyes. I gave birth to my first child- a little girl. Shortly after her birth, I decided to leave my job as a master's level social worker to become a full time stay at home mom. Almost a year later, I started writing for a local mom's blog, Chattanooga Moms Blog, and continued to develop my own website, Girls Inspiring Girls. While continuing to develop my skills, my husband encouraged me to learn how to code.For the past 4 months, I have been on a journey to learn code with a focus on front end web development. I have taken courses through Udacity, Codecademy, and TWP 3.0.</p>
