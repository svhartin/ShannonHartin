  <p> On August 17, 2016, my life changed right before my eyes. I gave birth to my first child- a little girl. Shortly after her birth, I decided to leave my job as a master's level social worker to become a full time stay at home mom.<p>
  <p> Almost a year later, I started writing for a local mom's blog, Chattanooga Moms Blog, and continued to develop my own website, <a href="girlsinsipiring.com">Girls Inspiring Girls</a>. While continuing to develop my skills, my husband encouraged me to learn how to code.</p>
  <p>For the past 4 months, I have been on a journey to learn code with focusing on front end web developmet. I have taken courses through Udacity, Codecademy, and TWP 3.0.</p>
