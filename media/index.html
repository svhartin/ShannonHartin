  <p>Hi there, I'm Shannon Hartin. I'm a twenty-something social worker turned stay-at-home-mom <s>turned</s> <em>turning</em> into a coder!</p>
  <br>
  <h2> Shannon's Journey </h2>
  <p> On August 17, 2016, my life changed right before my eyes. I gave birth to my first child - a little girl. Shortly after her birth, I decided to leave my job as a social worker to become a full time stay at home mom. Almost a year later, I started writing for a local mom's blog, Chattanooga Moms Blog, and continued to develop my own website, Girls Inspiring Girls - a website focused on young women's mental health.<p>
  <p>While developing my website, I had lots of questions and ideas to implement on my website. My husband, who is a computer science engineer, encouraged me to learn how to code. Since January 2018, I have been on a journey to learn code with a focus on front end web development. I have taken courses through Udacity, Codecademy, and TWP 3.0.</p>
